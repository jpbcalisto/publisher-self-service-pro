## ✅ Migration Completed Successfully

Your Publisher SSP Pro Bundle has been successfully migrated from Python to PHP Laravel with Docker.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Laravel Installation**
- Created a new Laravel 11 project using Laravel Sail
- Set up Docker-based development environment with:
  - PHP 8.4
  - MySQL 8.0
  - Redis
  - Meilisearch
  - Mailpit (for email testing)
  - Selenium (for browser testing)

### 2. **File Migration**
- Copied all existing assets, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to Laravel's `public/` directory
- Preserved all functionality of the original application
- Maintained the same file structure for frontend assets

### 3. **API Endpoints**
- Created `PublisherController.php` to handle all API endpoints previously managed by Python server
- Implemented the following endpoints:
  - `GET /list-assets` - List image assets
  - `POST /save-formats` - Save ad format configurations
  - `POST /save-cpm` - Save CPM pricing data
  - `POST /delete-asset` - Delete image assets
  - `POST /create-asset` - Create new assets
  - `POST /upload-image` - Upload images

### 4. **Configuration**
- Set up Laravel routes in `routes/web.php`
- Configured session handling (file-based)
- Generated application key
- Set up database migrations

### 5. **Development Tools**
- Created `start-server.sh` script for easy startup
- Updated README with Laravel-specific instructions
- Removed old Python server files

## How to Use

### Starting the Server
```bash
cd publisher-ssp
./start-server.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
bash vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

### Accessing the Application
- Main application: `http://localhost`
- Direct access: `http://localhost/publisherssp_pro.html`

- Format Manager: `http://localhost/format-manager.html`

### Stopping the Server
```bash
bash vendor/bin/sail down
```
